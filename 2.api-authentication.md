| API Authentication | A detailed introduction to API Authentiaction |

  # Why is Authentication necessary
  Authentication is used by a server when the server needs to know exactly who is accessing their information or site. Authentication is used by a client when the client needs to know that the server is system it claims to be. In authentication, the user or computer has to prove its identity to the server or client. Authentication ensures the client using our device are legit also authentication helps businesses to protect their customer's privacy.
  # API key
  An application programming interface (API) key is a code used to identify and authenticate an application or user. They also act as a unique identifier and provide a secret token for authentication purposes. An API key is passed by an application, which then calls the API to identify the user, developer, or program attempting to access a website. API keys are commonly used to control the utilization of the APIâ€™s interface and track how it is being used.
  When to use API Keys ?
  * Identify Usage Patterns in Your API's Traffic
  * Control the Number of Calls Made to Your API
  * Block Anonymous Traffic
  
# OAuth
OAuth (Open Authorization) is an open standard authorization framework for token-based authorization on the internet. OAuth is an open-standard authorization protocol or framework that describes how unrelated servers and services can safely allow authenticated access to their assets without actually sharing the initial, related, single logon credential.
  # Rate limiting
If many people are using our API's then, everyone using your database will suffer from slow performance for this purpose and also few others we use __API Limiting__ or __Rate Limiting__.
The other uses of Rate Limiting is to prevent DoS Attacks which  can tank a server with unlimited API requests.
  # Authentication vs Authorization
  usually Authentication and Authorization are spelled simultaneously but they are diffrent. Authorization comes after Authentication. 
__Authentication verifies the identity of a user or service, and authorization determines their access rights__
